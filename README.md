HarvardX: CS50AI

This repository contains my solutions to the projects of this course.
You should not use these codes for your own solutions in case you are doing 
the course. But you could study them for learning purposes.

Note: For project-5 (traffic), download the [data set](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) for this project and unzip it. Move the resulting `gtsrb` directory inside of your `traffic` directory.
