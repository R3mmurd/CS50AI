This repository contains my solutions to the projects of this course.
You should not use these codes for your own solutions in case you are doing
the course. But you could study them for learning purposes.

The course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence,
diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition,
and machine translation. It contains seven two-hours-lessons and one or two projects per lesson.

The following list of subdirectories contains my projects:

- **project-0**: Contains two projects for the problem "Search".
  See details [here](project-0/README.md).

  - **project-1**: Contains two projects for the problem "Knowledge".
  See details [here](project-1/README.md).

  - **project-2**: Contains two projects for the problem "Uncertainty".
  See details [here](project-2/README.md).

  - **project-3**: Contains one project for the problem "Optimization".
  See details [here](project-3/crossword/README.md).

  - **project-4**: Contains two projects for the problem "Learning".
  See details [here](project-4/README.md).

  - **project-5**: Contains two projects for the problem "Neural Networks".
  See details [here](project-5/traffic/README.md).

  - **project-6**: Contains two projects for the problem "Language".
  See details [here](project-6/README.md).



Note: For project-5 (traffic), download the [data set](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) for this project and unzip it. Move the resulting `gtsrb` directory inside of your `traffic` directory.
